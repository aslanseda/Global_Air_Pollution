# Project Purpose: Investigating Air Pollution Patterns and Impacts

The purpose of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of air pollution data with the aim of uncovering critical insights into the patterns, sources, and potential impacts of air pollution on countries. Air pollution is a pressing global issue with far-reaching consequences for human health, the environment, and the economy. By undertaking this analysis, we seek to contribute to a deeper understanding of the complexities surrounding air quality and provide valuable information that can guide informed decision-making at various levels.

# Context
Air Pollution is contamination of the indoor or outdoor environment by any chemical, physical, or biological agent that modifies the natural characteristics of the atmosphere. Household combustion devices, motor vehicles, industrial facilities, and forest fires are common sources of air pollution. Pollutants of major public health concern include particulate matter, carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide. Outdoor and indoor air pollution cause respiratory and other diseases and are important sources of morbidity and mortality.

This dataset provides geolocated information about the following pollutants:

Nitrogen Dioxide [NO2]: Nitrogen Dioxide is one of the several nitrogen oxides. It is introduced into the air by natural phenomena like entry from the stratosphere or lighting. At the surface level, however, NO2 forms from cars, trucks, and buses emissions, power plants, and off-road equipment. Exposure over short periods can aggravate respiratory diseases, like asthma. Longer exposures may contribute to the development of asthma and respiratory infections. People with asthma, children, and the elderly are at greater risk for the health effects of NO2.

Ozone [O3]: The Ozone molecule is harmful to outdoor air quality (if outside of the ozone layer). At the surface level, ozone is created by chemical reactions between oxides of nitrogen and volatile organic compounds (VOC). Different from the good ozone located in the upper atmosphere, ground-level ozone can provoke several health problems like chest pain, coughing, throat irritation, and airway inflammation. Furthermore, it can reduce lung function and worsen bronchitis, emphysema, and asthma. Ozone affects also vegetation and ecosystems. In particular, it damages sensitive vegetation during the growing season.

Carbon Monoxide [CO]: Carbon Monoxide is a colorless and odorless gas. Outdoor, it is emitted in the air above all by cars, trucks, and other vehicles or machineries that burn fossil fuels. Such items like kerosene and gas space heaters, gas stoves also release CO affecting indoor air quality.
Breathing air with a high concentration of CO reduces the amount of oxygen that can be transported in the bloodstream to critical organs like the heart and brain, at very high levels, which are not likely to occur outdoors but which are possible in enclosed environments. CO can cause dizziness, confusion, unconsciousness, and death.

Particulate Matter [PM2.5]: Atmospheric Particulate Matter, also known as atmospheric aerosol particles, are complex mixtures of small solid and liquid matter that get into the air. If inhaled they can cause serious heart and lung problems. They have been classified as a group 1 carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). PM10 refers to those particles with a diameter of 10 micrometers or less. PM2.5 refers to those particles with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less.

# Findings
[Please check the Tableau Storyboard for details](https://public.tableau.com/views/airpolluton/Story1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) 

- Particulate matter (PM2.5) level is increasing in all the countries and this is affecting the air quality very badly. Countries must act to reduce particulars to the air. 

- Russia, the USA, and India are the top 3 countries that have bad air quality which is very dangerous for health. 

- Palau, Solon Islands, and Maldives are the top 3 countries that have the cleanest air quality.

- Trinidad and Tobago, Yemen, and Myanmar are at risk because the air quality is already dangerous for sensitive groups. These countries must act fast to make the air healthier.
